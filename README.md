# Hackathon platform DAPP project for D_D hackaton!

This aims to be a simple yet powerfull hackaton platform. This system relies on NFTs to give proof of different participations on the hackaton, example: A hacker receives an NFT for joining the hackaton, others for getting achievements right, and of course, if they get a prize in the hackaton. Judges and Organizer can also receive NFTs to serve as proof of their participation on the hackatons.

A quick glance of the concept (NFT distribution is not represented here):

With the time constraints of the current hackaton, we are not getting to have all this features working on this release, but weÂ´re aiming to build a complete DAPP in the future
